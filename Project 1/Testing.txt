For our first test we decided to work with the sample.dump as we had a .s and .output provided for us.
This gave us a good test for general functionality and formatting with no memory testing.

Testcase1 was used to check if unsupported functions were rejected.

Testcase2 was then used to test our sw and lw functionality in a loop where the addresses were dependant on previous loads.

Testcase3 was used to check if memory locations not offset by words were rejected.

Testcase4 was used to check if invalid memory locations were rejected ie no allocation.

Testcase5 was the most extensive test case in which we used every supported function and checked if the inputs, outputs, and behaviors were expected.
