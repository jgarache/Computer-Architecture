Table of Contents:

Project 1 - MIPS Instruction Inerpreter:

Created an instruction interpreter for a subset of MIPS code. The interpreter starts with the assembled instructions in memory and then fetchs, disassembles, decodes, and executes MIPS machine instructions, simulating each stage in the computation.

Project 2 - TIPS (Thousands of Instructions Per Second):

Expands upon the MIPS interpreter in Project 1 and implements cache logic.

Project 3 - Matrix Multiplication:

Created a matrix multiplication in an attempt of computing the multiplication as fast as possible.
